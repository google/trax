def MaxPool(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=None, padding="VALID"):
    """Reduces each multi-dimensional window to the max of the window's values.

    Windows, as specified by `pool_size` and `strides`, involve all axes of an
    n-dimensional array except the first and last: :math:`(d_1, ..., d_{n-2})`
    from shape :math:`(d_0, d_1, ..., d_{n-2}, d_{n-1})`.

    Args:
      pool_size: Shape of window that gets reduced to a single vector value.
          If the layer inputs are :math:`n`-dimensional arrays, then `pool_size`
          must be a tuple of length :math:`n-2`.
      strides: Offsets from the location of one window to the locations of
          neighboring windows along each axis. If specified, must be a tuple of
          the same length as `pool_size`. If None, then offsets of 1 along each
          window axis, :math:`(1, ..., 1)`, will be used.
      padding: 'VALID' or 'SAME'. If 'VALID', no padding is done, and only
          full windows get reduced; partial windows are discarded. If 'SAME',
          padding is added at array edges as needed to avoid partial windows
          but does not otherwise affect the selection of max values.

    Returns:
      N-dimensional array in which each valid (or padded-valid) window position
      in the input is reduced to / replaced by the max value from that window.
      An output array has the same number of dimensions as its input, but has
      fewer elements.
