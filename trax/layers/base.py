class Layer:
  """Base class for composable layers in a deep learning network.

  Layers are the basic building blocks for deep learning models. A layer
  computes a function from zero or more inputs to zero or more outputs,
  optionally using trainable weights (common) and non-parameter state (not
  common).

  Layer subclasses typically override at most two methods of the base `Layer`
  class:

    `forward(inputs)`:
      Computes the layer's output as part of a forward pass through the model.

    `init_weights_and_state(self, input_signature)`:
      Initializes the layer's weights and state to handle input with the given
      signature (number, shapes and dtypes of input arguments).

  A small number of layer types are combinators -- they organize the computation
  of their sublayers, e.g., applying their sublayers in series or in parallel.

  All layers have the following properties, with default values implemented
  in the base `Layer` class:

    - `n_in`: int (default 1)
    - `n_out`: int (default 1)
    - `weights`: tuple (default empty -- the layer has no weights)
    - `state`: tuple (default empty -- the layer has no non-parameter state)
    - `sublayers`: tuple (default empty -- the layer has no sublayers)

  The inputs to a layer are tensors, packaged according to how many there are:

    - `n_in = 0`: an empty tuple
    - `n_in = 1`: one tensor (NOT wrapped in a tuple)
    - `n_in > 1`: a tuple of tensors

  (The special treatment of the single-input case is meant to simplify the
  work of layer writers; this design choice may be revisited in the future.)

  The outputs from a layer are also tensors, packaged the same as layer inputs:

    - `n_out = 0`: an empty tuple
    - `n_out = 1`: the tensor (NOT wrapped in a tuple)
    - `n_out > 1`: a tuple of tensors

  The Trax runtime maintains a data stack with which layer calls are composed.
  For more complex data network architectures, possibly involving multiple data
  flows, one can view each layer as a function from stack state to stack state,
  where the function's inputs are a slice from the stack, and the function's
  outputs are spliced back into the stack.
