    "**Tokenizing the sentences using subword representations:** we want to represent each sentence as an array of integers instead of strings. For our application, we will use *subword* representations to tokenize our sentences. This is a common technique to avoid out-of-vocabulary words by allowing parts of words to be represented separately. For example, instead of having separate entries in your vocabulary for \"fear\", \"fearless\", \"fearsome\", \"some\", and \"less\", you can simply store \"fear\", \"some\", and \"less\" then allow your tokenizer to combine these subwords when needed. This allows it to be more flexible so you won't have to save uncommon words explicitly in your vocabulary (e.g. *stylebender*, *nonce*, etc). Tokenizing is done with the `trax.data.Tokenize()` command. The combined subword vocabulary for English, German and French (i.e. `endefr_32k.subword`) is provided by trax. Feel free to open this file to see how the subwords look like."

    "but the gist is very simple. Our inputs have variable lengths and you want to make these the same when batching groups of sentences together. One way to do that is to pad each sentence to the length of the longest sentence in the dataset. This might lead to some wasted computation though. For example, if there are multiple short sentences with just two tokens, do we want to pad these when the longest sentence is composed of a 100 tokens? Instead of padding with 0s to the maximum length of a sentence each time, we can group our tokenized sentences by length and bucket, as on this image (from the article above):\n",

For instance, if we generated 30 sentences, we will need to compare sentence 1 to sentences 2 to 30. Then, we compare sentence 2 to sentences 1 and 3 to 30, and so forth. At each step, we get the average score of all comparisons to get the overall score for a particular sample. To illustrate, these will be the steps to generate the scores of a 4-sample list.\n",
