class Layer(object):
  """Base class for composable layers in a deep learning network.

  Layers are the basic building blocks for deep learning models. A Trax layer
  computes a function from zero or more inputs to zero or more outputs,
  optionally using trainable weights (common) and non-parameter state (not
  common). Authors of new layer subclasses typically override at most two
  methods of the base `Layer` class:

    forward(inputs, weights):
      Computes this layer's output as part of a forward pass through the model.

    new_weights(self, input_signature):
      Returns new weights suitable for inputs with the given signature.

  A small subset of layer types are combinators -- they organize the computation
  of their sublayers, e.g., applying their sublayers in series or in parallel.

  All layers have the following properties, with default values implemented
  in the base `Layer` class:

    - n_in: int (default 1)
    - n_out: int (default 1)
    - weights: tuple (default empty -- the layer has no weights)
    - state: tuple (default empty -- the layer has no non-parameter state)
    - sublayers: tuple (default empty -- the layer has no sublayers)

  The inputs to a layer are tensors, packaged according to how many there are:

    - n_in = 0: an empty tuple ()
    - n_in = 1: one tensor (NOT wrapped in a tuple)
    - n_in > 1: a tuple of tensors

  (The special treatment of the single-input case is meant to simplify the
  work of layer writers; this design choice may be revisited in the future.)

  The outputs from a layer are also tensors, packaged the same as layer inputs:

    - n_out = 0: an empty tuple ()
    - n_out = 1: the tensor (NOT wrapped in a tuple)
    - n_out > 1: a tuple of tensors

  The Trax runtime maintains a data stack with which layer calls are composed.
  For more complex data network architectures, possibly involving multiple data
  flows, one can view each layer as a function from stack state to stack state,
  where the function's inputs are a slice from the stack, and the function's
  outputs are spliced back into the stack.
